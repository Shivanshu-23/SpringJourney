## 1. Introduction to Spring Boot

- **What is Spring Boot?**  
  Spring Boot is a framework designed to simplify the development of Java-based applications by providing an opinionated approach to configuration.
  
- **Key Features and Benefits**  
  It offers auto-configuration, embedded servers (Tomcat/Jetty), and production-ready features like monitoring, health checks, and externalized configurations.

- **Spring vs. Spring Boot**  
  Spring is a large ecosystem of projects (Core, Data, Security, etc.), while Spring Boot streamlines the setup process with embedded web servers, auto-configuration, and starters.

---

## 2. Spring Boot Basics

- **Setting up a Spring Boot Project**  
  Use [Spring Initializr](https://start.spring.io/) or your preferred IDE to generate a basic project structure with required dependencies.

- **Spring Boot Starters**  
  Starters simplify dependency management by bundling common libraries, like `spring-boot-starter-web` for web applications.

- **Running and Debugging Spring Boot Applications**  
  Spring Boot apps can be run directly using `mvn spring-boot:run` or the main method. Debugging is simplified with detailed logs.

---

## 3. Dependency Injection & Inversion of Control (IoC)

- **IoC Concepts**  
  Inversion of Control shifts the responsibility of managing objects to the framework, allowing for loose coupling.

- **Dependency Injection in Spring**  
  Spring Boot injects dependencies using constructor or setter injection with the `@Autowired` annotation.

- **Bean Scopes and Lifecycles**  
  Spring beans can be scoped as `singleton`, `prototype`, etc., to manage the lifecycle of objects.

---

## 4. Spring Boot Annotations

- **Common Spring Boot Annotations**  
  - `@RestController`: Marks a class as a controller that returns JSON/XML responses.
  - `@Autowired`: Injects dependencies automatically.
  - `@Service`, `@Repository`, `@Component`: Used to define service, repository, and general beans.

- **Conditional Annotations**  
  `@ConditionalOnProperty`, `@ConditionalOnMissingBean` allow bean creation based on certain conditions.

---

## 5. Spring Boot Data Access (JPA & Hibernate)

- **Introduction to JPA**  
  JPA (Java Persistence API) is a specification for object-relational mapping (ORM). Hibernate is the default JPA implementation used in Spring Boot.

- **Spring Data JPA Repositories**  
  It provides interfaces like `CrudRepository` and `JpaRepository` for database operations.

- **CRUD Operations**  
  Basic operations like `save()`, `findById()`, `delete()`, and `findAll()` are simplified through Spring Data JPA.

- **Entity Relationships**  
  Define relationships using annotations like `@OneToOne`, `@OneToMany`, `@ManyToMany` to map tables.

- **Custom Queries**  
  Use `@Query` to define JPQL or native queries for custom operations.

---

## 6. Spring Boot Security

- **Introduction to Spring Security**  
  Spring Security provides authentication and authorization capabilities to secure applications.

- **Basic and Role-Based Authentication**  
  Configure in-memory or database-based authentication to secure APIs, and assign roles using `@PreAuthorize`.

- **JWT and OAuth2 Authentication**  
  Use JWT tokens for stateless authentication and integrate with OAuth2 for external providers like Google, Facebook.

---

## 7. Building REST APIs with Spring Boot

- **REST Principles and Best Practices**  
  REST APIs are stateless and rely on HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE. Always follow standard conventions.

- **Building RESTful Endpoints**  
  Use `@RestController` and map requests to methods with `@GetMapping`, `@PostMapping`, etc.

- **Exception Handling**  
  Use `@ControllerAdvice` and `@ExceptionHandler` to handle errors in a clean and structured manner.

- **Input Validation**  
  Validate incoming data using `@Valid` and custom validation annotations on request bodies.

---

## 8. Spring Boot Testing

- **Unit Testing with JUnit and Mockito**  
  Write tests for individual components using JUnit and Mockito to mock dependencies.

- **Integration Testing**  
  Test the full application flow using Spring's testing framework with `@SpringBootTest`.

- **Testing REST APIs**  
  Use `MockMvc` to test your REST endpoints without starting the server.

---

## 9. Spring Boot Microservices

- **Introduction to Microservices**  
  Microservices is an architecture style that decomposes applications into small, loosely coupled services.

- **Service Discovery with Eureka**  
  Use Netflix Eureka for service registration and discovery in distributed systems.

- **API Gateway and Circuit Breakers**  
  Use Spring Cloud Gateway as an API Gateway and Resilience4j for handling failures with circuit breakers.

---

## 10. Spring Boot Deployment

- **Packaging Spring Boot Applications (JAR/WAR)**  
  Build Spring Boot apps into executable JAR or deployable WAR files with Maven or Gradle.

- **Deploying on Tomcat, Docker, AWS, Kubernetes, etc.**  
  Deploy Spring Boot applications on Tomcat, create Docker containers, and scale using AWS or Kubernetes.

---

## 11. Advanced Topics

- **Caching**  
  Use `@Cacheable` for caching method results to improve performance.

- **WebSockets**  
  Enable real-time communication using Spring Boot WebSocket support.

- **Asynchronous Programming**  
  Handle asynchronous tasks with `@Async` annotation and `CompletableFuture`.

- **Spring Boot Actuator and Monitoring**  
  Actuator provides production-ready endpoints for monitoring, like health checks and metrics.
